# ***Welcome!***

Hi all, Iâ€™m Jakeb Chouinard! I'm a Mechatronic Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I have a strong interest in robotics and mechatronics projects, which is why I have this GitHub account. I'm currently engaged in improving my knowledge in a variety of things, such as Python, C++, and the Matlab Scripting Langauge. My experience in these is limited primarily to my academic coursework and indpendent projects, both of which I am hoping to showcase here.

## **Mathworks Engineering Innovation Project 208: Raceline Optimization**
![Raceline Optimizer](https://github.com/borealis31/MW208_AUTON_RACECARS/blob/main/OblongTest.gif)

This project comes from the [Mathworks EI Project 208](https://github.com/mathworks/MathWorks-Excellence-in-Innovation/tree/main/projects/Path%20Planning%20for%20Autonomous%20Race%20Cars) and uses a localized mathematical approach to optimizing the curvature of a raceline around a track. This raceline is optimized iteratively until a certain threshold is met; at which point, the program begins to develop a velocity profile. This velocity profile is optimized for the curvature of the optimized raceline and is constrained by maximum tangential and centripetal forces. This output can be returned as a real-time video of the "car" going around the track as well as a plot PNG of the velocity profile colorized to indicate high speed and low speed regions. Currently, the velocity profile is based around the physics of a point mass; however, I am hoping to develop a velocity profile generator based around a half-car dynamics model.

## **Matlab/C++ Port Sorting Simulator**
![Port Simulator](https://github.com/borealis31/The_Shipyard/blob/main/matlab/testCases/testCase1Output.PNG)

This is one of my first forays into the world of object oriented programming and recursive functions. This code contains three classes and three functions â€” one of which is a recursive merge sort function designed to sort objects of a certain class by two different properties depending on the application. The code is well documented and uses built-in MATLAB functions to identify errors in function and class implementation. If you're interested in learning more, [check out the code here](https://github.com/borealis31/The_Shipyard). I'm also looking to create a full C++ version of this as well now that the MATLAB version is complete; however, this is put on pause as I work on other projects.

## **RasPi Zero W "Car"**
![RPZWCar](https://github.com/borealis31/borealis31/blob/main/20210318_171800.jpg)

This is a fairly simple project with complex wiring. Since I didn't have any modules or drivers for DC motors, I
decided to use two L298D H-Bridge components, a breadboard, and a whole lot of wires. This project is powered
by a RasPi Zero W which receives IR signal and iteratively acts based on received signal to control direction.
It is capable of moving forward-backward, turning, and strafing. See [the code for this here](https://github.com/borealis31/robo_rpi0w).

## **Matlab .txt Analyzer (Analytical Statistics)**
![Statistical Text Analyzer](https://github.com/borealis31/stats_analytics_school_project/blob/main/pride_and_prejudice_results.png)

This is a group project for my Statistics course, for which I was responsible for creating the Matlab script to
analyze public domain text files hosted by Project Guttenberg and to find statistical characteristic values for
word length. See [the code for this here](https://github.com/borealis31/Engineering-Statistics_Term-Project).
