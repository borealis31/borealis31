#Welcome!

Hi all, Iâ€™m Jakeb Chouinard! I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.
I have a strong interest in robotics and mechatronics projects, which is why I have this GitHub account.
I'm currently engaged in improving my knowledge in a variety of things, such as Python, C++, and the Matlab Scripting Langauge.
My experience in these is limited primarily to my academic coursework and indpendent projects, both of which I am
planning to showcase here.

##RasPi Zero W "Car"

This is a fairly simple project with complex wiring. Since I didn't have any modules or drivers for DC motors, I
decided to use two L298D H-Bridge components, a breadboard, and a whole lot of wires. This project is powered
by a RasPi Zero W which receives IR signal and iteratively acts based on received signal to control direction.
It is capable of moving forward-backward, turning, and strafing. The next steps are to implement an IMU to control
rotation to ensure lateral strafing.
